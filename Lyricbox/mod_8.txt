[Verse 1:]\nSome people long for a life that is simple and planned\nTied with a ribbon\nSome people won't sail the sea 'cause they're safer on land\nTo follow what's written\nBut I'd follow you to the great unknown\nOff to a world we call our own\n\n[Chorus:]\nHand in my hand\nAnd we promised to never let go\nWe're walking the tightrope\nHigh in the sky\nWe can see the whole world down below\nWe're walking the tightrope\nNever sure, never know how far we could fall\nBut it's all an adventure\nThat comes with a breathtaking view\nWalking the tightrope\n\n[Post-Chorus:]\nWith you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nWith you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nWith you\n\n[Verse 2:]\nMountains and valleys, and all that will come in between\nDesert and ocean\nYou pulled me in and together we're lost in a dream\nAlways in motion\nSo I risk it all just to be with you\nAnd I risk it all for this life we choose\n\n[Chorus:]\nHand in my hand\nAnd you promised to never let go\nWe're walking the tightrope\nHigh in the sky\nWe can see the whole world down below\nWe're walking the tightrope\nNever sure, will you catch me if I should fall?\nWell, it's all an adventure\nThat comes with a breathtaking view\nWalking the tightrope\n\n[Post-Chorus:]\nWith you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nWith you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nWith you\nWith you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Outro:]\nWith you, ooh-ooh-ooh\nWith you\n
