[Verse：Loren Allred：]\nI'm trying to hold my breath\nLet it stay this way\nCan't let this moment end\nYou set off a dream with me\nGetting louder now\nCan you hear it echoing?\nTake my hand\nWill you share this with me?\n'Cause darling without you\n\n[Chorus: Loren Allred:]\nAll the shine of a thousand spotlights\nAll the stars we steal from the nightsky\nWill never be enough\nNever be enough\nTowers of gold are still too little\nThese hands could hold the world but it'll\nNever be enough\nNever be enough\n\n[Post-Chorus: Loren Allred:]\nFor me\nNever, never\nNever, never\nNever, for me\nFor me\nNever enough\nNever enough\nNever enough\nFor me\nFor me\nFor me\n\n[Chorus: Loren Allred]\nAll the shine of a thousand spotlights\nAll the stars we steal from the nightsky\nWill never be enough\nNever be enough\nTowers of gold are still too little\nThese hands could hold the world but it'll\nNever be enough\nNever be enough\n\n[Post-Chorus: Loren Allred]\nFor me\nNever, never\nNever, never\nNever, for me\nFor me\nNever enough\nNever, never\nNever enough\nNever, never\nNever enough\nFor me\nFor me\nFor me\n\n[Outro: Loren Allred]\nFor me\n
