[Hugh Jackman]\nI saw the sun begin to dim\nAnd felt that winter wind\nBlow cold\nA man learns who is there for him\nWhen the glitter fades and the walls won't hold\nCause from then, rubble\nWhat remains\nCan only be what's true\nIf all was lost\nIs more I gain\nCause it led me back\nTo you\n\nFrom now on\nThese eyes will not be blinded by the light\nFrom now on\nWhat's waited till tomorrow starts tonight\nTonight\nLet this promise in me start\nLike an anthem in my heart\nFrom now on\nFrom now on\n\nI drank champagne with kings and queens\nThe politicians praised my name\nBut those are someone else's dreams\nThe pitfalls of the man I became\nFor years and years\nI chased their cheers\nThe crazy speed of always needing more\nBut when I stop\nAnd see you here\nI remember who all this was for\n\nAnd from now on\nThese eyes will not be blinded by the light\nFrom now on\nWhat's waited till tomorrow starts tonight\nIt starts tonight\nAnd let the promise in me start\nLike an anthem in my heart\nFrom now on\nFrom now on\nFrom now on\n\n[Ensemble]\nAnd we will come back home\nAnd we will come back home\nHome, again! (x3)\n\n[Hugh Jackman]\nFrom now on!\n\n[Ensemble]\nAnd we will come back home\nAnd we will come back home\nHome, again!
