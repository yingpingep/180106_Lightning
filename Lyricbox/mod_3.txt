[Verse 1:Hugh Jackman]\nYou stumble through your days\nGot your head hung low\nYour skies' a shade of grey\nLike a zombie in a maze\nYou're asleep inside\nBut you can shake away\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Hugh Jackman]\n'Cause you're just a dead man walking\nThinking that's your only option\nBut you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day\nSun is up and the color's blinding\nTake the world and redefine it\nLeave behind your narrow mind\nYou'll never be the same\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Hugh Jackman]\nCome alive, come alive\nGo and ride your light\nLet it burn so bright\nReaching up\nTo the sky\nAnd it's open wide\nYou're electrified\n\n[Chorus: Hugh Jackman]\nWhen the world becomes a fantasy\nAnd you're more than you could ever be\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nAnd you know you can't go back again\nTo the world that you were living in\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nSo, come alive!\n\n[Verse 2: Hugh Jackman]\nI see it in your eyes\nYou believe that lie\nThat you need to hide your face\nAfraid to step outside\nSo you lock the door\nBut don't you stay that way\n\n[Keala Settle]\nNo more living in those shadows\nYou and me we know how that goes\n\n[Daniel Everidge]\n'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same\n\n[Both]\nWe'll be the light that's shining\nBottle up and keep on trying\n\n[All]\nYou can prove there's more to you\n\n[Hugh Jackman]\nYou cannot be afraid\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ensemble]\nCome alive, come alive\nGo and ride your light\nLet it burn so bright\nReaching up\nTo the sky\nAnd it's open wide\nYou're electrified\n\n[Chorus: Ensemble]\nWhen the world becomes a fantasy\nAnd you're more than you could ever be\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nAnd we know we can't be go back again\nTo the world that we were living in\n'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open\nSo, come alive!\n\n[Ensemble:]\nCome one!\nCome all!\nCome in!\nCome on!\n\n[Zendaya:]\nTo anyone who's bursting with a dream\n\n[Ensemble:]\nCome one!\nCome all!\nYou hear\nThe call\n\n[Hugh Jackman:]\nTo anyone who's searching for a way to break free\n\n[Ensemble:]\nBreak free!\nBreak free!\n\n[Chorus: Ensemble and Hugh Jackman:]\nWhen the world becomes a fantasy\nAnd you're more than you could ever be\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nAnd we know we can't be go back again\nTo the world that we were living in\n'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open\n(Hey!)\n\n[Chorus: Ensemble and Hugh Jackman]\nWhen the world becomes a fantasy\nAnd you're more than you could ever be\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nAnd we know we can't be go back again\nTo the world that we were living in\n'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open\n\n[Outro: Ensemble and Hugh Jackman]\n'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open\n\nSo come alive! (Come alive!)\n
