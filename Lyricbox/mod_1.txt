[Verse 1:Ziv Zaifman]\nI close my eyes and I can see\nThe world that's waiting up for me\nThat I call my own\nThrough the dark, through the door\nThrough where no one's been before\nBut it feels like home\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ziv Zaifman]\nThey can say, they can say it all sounds crazy\nThey can say, they can say I've lost my mind\nI don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy\nWe can live in a world that we design\n\n[Chorus: Ziv Zaifman]\n'Cause every night I lie in bed\nThe brightest colors fill my head\nA million dreams are keeping me awake\nI think of what the world could be\nA vision of the one I see\nA million dreams is all it's gonna take\nA million dreams for the world we're gonna make\n\n[Verse 2: Ziv Zaifman]\nThere's a house we can build\nEvery room inside is filled\nWith things from far away\nThe special things I compile\nEach one there to make you smile\nOn a rainy day\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ziv Zaifman]\nThey can say, they can say it all sounds crazy\nThey can say, they can say we've lost our minds\nI don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy\nRunaway to a world that we design\n\n[Chorus: Hugh Jackman]\nEvery night I lie in bed\nThe brightest colors fill my head\nA million dreams are keeping me awake\nI think of what the world could be\nA vision of the one I see\nA million dreams is all it's gonna take\nA million dreams for the world we're gonna make\n\n[Bridge: Michelle Williams, with Hugh Jackman]\nHowever big, however small\nLet me be part of it all\nShare your dreams with me\nYou may be right, you may be wrong\nBut say that you'll bring me along\nTo the world you see\nTo the world I close my eyes to see\nI close my eyes to see\n\n[Chorus: Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, together]\nEvery night I lie in bed\nThe brightest colors fill my head\nA million dreams are keeping me awake\nA million dreams, a million dreams\nI think of what the world could be\nA vision of the one I see\nA million dreams is all it's gonna take\nA million dreams for the world we're gonna make\n
