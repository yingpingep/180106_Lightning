You know I want you\nIt's not a secret I try to hide\nI know you want me\nSo don't keep saying our hands are tied\nYou claim it's not in the cards\nBut fate is pulling you miles away\nAnd out of reach from me\nBut you're here in my heart\nSo who can stop me if I decide\nThat you're my destiny?\n\nWhat if we rewrite the stars?\nSay you were made to be mine\nNothing could keep us apart\nYou'd be the one I was meant to find\nIt's up to you, and it's up to me\nNo one can say what we get to be\nSo why don't we rewrite the stars?\nMaybe the world could be ours\nTonight\n\nYou think it's easy\nYou think I don't want to run to you\nBut there are mountains\nAnd there are doors that we can't walk through\nI know you're wondering why\nBecause we're able to be\nJust you and me\nWithin these walls\nBut when we go outside\nYou're going to wake up and see that it was hopeless after all\n\nNo one can rewrite the stars\nHow can you say you'll be mine?\nEverything keeps us apart\nAnd I'm not the one you were meant to find\nIt's not up to you\nIt's not up to me\nWhen everyone tells us what we can be\nHow can we rewrite the stars?\nSay that the world can be ours\nTonight\n\nAll I want is to fly with you\nAll I want is to fall with you\nSo just give me all of you\n\nIt feels impossible\n\nIt's not impossible\n\nIs it impossible?\n\nSay that it's possible\n\nHow do we rewrite the stars?\nSay you were made to be mine?\nNothing can keep us apart\nCause you are the one I was meant to find\nIt's up to you\nAnd it's up to me\nNo one can say what we get to be\nAnd why don't we rewrite the stars?\nChanging the world to be ours\n\nYou know I want you\nIt's not a secret I try to hide\nBut I can't have you\nWe're bound to break and\nMy hands are tied\n
