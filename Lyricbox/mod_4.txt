[Verse 1:Hugh Jackman]\nRight here, right now\nI put the offer out\nI don't want to chase you down\nI know you see it\nYou run with me\nAnd I can cut you free\nOut of the treachery and walls you keep in\nSo trade that typical for something colorful\nAnd if it's crazy, live a little crazy\nYou can play it sensible, a king of conventional\nOr you can risk it all and see\n\n[Chorus: Hugh Jackman]\nDon't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play\n'Cause I got what you need\nSo come with me and take the ride\nIt'll take you to the other side\n'Cause you can do like you do\nOr you can do like me\nStay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key\nOh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly\nIt'll take you to the other side\n\n[Verse 2: Zac Efron]\nOkay, my friend, you want to cut me in\nWell I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen\nSo thanks, but no\nI think I'm good to go\n'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in\nNow I admire you, and that whole show you do\nYou're onto something, really it's something\nBut I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells\nI'll have to leave that up to you\n\n[Chorus: Zac Efron]\nDon't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play\n'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride\nI don't need to see the other side\nSo go and do like you do\nI'm good to do like me\nAin't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key\nOh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine\nI don't need to see the other side\n\n[Verse 3:]\n[Hugh]\nNow is this really how you like to spend your days?\nWhiskey and misery, and parties and plays\n\n[Zac]\nIf I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town\nDisgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns\n\n[Hugh]\nBut you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little\nJust let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll\nWake you up and cure your aching\nTake your walls and start 'em breaking\nNow that's a deal that seems worth taking\nBut I guess I'll leave that up to you\n\n[Bridge:]\n[Zac]\nWell it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly\nSo what percentage of the show would I be taking?\n\n[Hugh]\nFair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action\nI'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen\n\n[Zac]\nI wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine\n\n[Hugh]\nWhy not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime\n\n[Zac]\nFifteen\n\n[Hugh]\nI'd do eight\n\n[Zac]\nTwelve\n\n[Hugh]\nMaybe nine\n\n[Zac]\nTen\n\n[Chorus: Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron]\nDon't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play\n'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride\nTo the other side\nSo if you do like I do\nSo if you do like me\nForget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key\nOh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly\nWe're going to the other side\nSo if you do like I do\n(To the other side)\nSo if you do like me\n(We're going to the other side)\n'Cause if we do we're going to the other side\nWe're going to the other side\n
