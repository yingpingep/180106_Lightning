[Verse 1]\nI am not a stranger to the dark\nHide away, they say\n'Cause we don't want your broken parts\nI've learned to be ashamed of all my scars\nRun away, they say\nNo one'll love you as you are\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I won't let them break me down to dust\nI know that there's a place for us\nFor we are glorious\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sharpest words wanna cut me down\nI'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out\nI am brave, I am bruised\nI am who I'm meant to be, this is me\nLook out 'cause here I come\nAnd I'm marching on to the beat I drum\nI'm not scared to be seen\nI make no apologies, this is me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnother round of bullets hits my skin\nWell, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in\nWe are bursting through the barricades\nAnd reaching for the sun (we are warriors)\nYeah, that's what we've become\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWon't let them break me down to dust\nI know that there's a place for us\nFor we are glorious\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sharpest words wanna cut me down\nGonna send a flood, gonna drown them out\nI am brave, I am bruised\nI am who I'm meant to be, this is me\nLook out 'cause here I come\nAnd I'm marching on to the beat I drum\nI'm not scared to be seen\nI make no apologies, this is me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh\nThis is me\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I know that I deserve your love\nThere's nothing I'm not worthy of\nWhen the sharpest words wanna cut me down\nI'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out\nThis is brave, this is proof\nThis is who I'm meant to be, this is me\n\n[Chorus]\nLook out 'cause here I come (look out 'cause here I come)\nAnd I'm marching on to the beat I drum (marching on, marching, marching on)\nI'm not scared to be seen\nI make no apologies, this is me\n\n[Outro]\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)\nI'm gonna send a flood\nGonna drown them out\n(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, this is me)\n
