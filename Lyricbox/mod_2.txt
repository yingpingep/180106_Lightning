[Chorusï¼šAustyn Johnson, with Cameron Seely, Hugh Jackman]\nEvery night I lie in bed\nThe brightest colors fill my head\nA million dreams are keeping me awake\nI think of what the world could be\nA vision of the one I see\nA million dreams is all it's gonna take\nA million dreams for the world we're gonna make\n
